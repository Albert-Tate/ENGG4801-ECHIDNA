# ENGG4801-ECHIDNA

Thesis Project for ENGG4801 Thesis as part of the Bachelor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Queensland.

The board used for this project is custom and will likely be detailed on here when I can figure out a way how to do it without uploading too much data. Any queries email me directly at albert.c.tate@gmail.com
